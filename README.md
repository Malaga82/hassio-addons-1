# meross-hassio-addons
Hassio addons forked from Carlo Satta repo.
Updated meross-cloud and mqtt version.

MUST USE UP TO 10 CHARS PASSWORD.

As a suggestion, even if frequency is editable, leave it at 30 sec to prevent temporary ban from meross cloud.

Since i barely did some changes i'll give like 0 support.

Development state: Some things needs to be fixed, i'm not a node js dev so i need attempts to achieve that in my spare time.
Also, if you have any plug with hw version 1.0, you could expect idplug_0_power to not be reported after some time: still testing but seems a meross cloud thing.
It's fine with hw version 2.0

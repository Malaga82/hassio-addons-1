## Devices
For now the addons was tested with this devices:
 - [MSS425F - Smart Wi-Fi Surge Protector (EU/FR/US/JP)](http://www.meross.com/products/home_automation/smart_wi_fi_surge_protect/36.html)
 - [MSS310 - Smart Wi-Fi Plug with Energy Monitor (UK/EU/US/AU/FR/IT)](http://www.meross.com/products/home_automation/smart_wi_fi_plug/22.html)

Probably  it's work with other devices.

## Instruction
All the devices have to be  configured via the Meross app.

The addons was created to work out of the box with [MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/), so I suggest to add at your *`configuration.yaml`* the following configurations:

 ```
Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  discovery: true
  discovery_prefix: homeassistant
```


Edit the addons config:
